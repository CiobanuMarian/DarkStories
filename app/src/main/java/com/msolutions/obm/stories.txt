Every weekday a man takes the elevator down from his apartment to go to work. When he returns, he sometimes takes the elevator all the way up, but usually takes the elevator to the 12th floor and then takes the stairs from there. Why?
He's really short so he can't push a button any higher than 12. Except when it's raining. Then he carries his umbrella and can use that to push his floor.
A man gets into an elevator, and seconds later, he knows his wife is dead. How?
She's on life support and the power in the building just went out and he's stuck in the elevator.
A man is dead in a desert, completely naked except he is holding something in his hand. What happened?
He and two friends were in a hot air balloon that was going down too soon. To stay up long enough to escape the desert, they had thrown everything overboard, even all their clothes. When that still wasn't enough, they drew straws taken from the balloon basket. He drew the longest straw, which he still had in his hand.
